what I know about markdowm .
### Markdown is:

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor.

## What is the point of markdown?
its goal is to allow people “to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, and optionally convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).” Because Markdown text files are plain text, you can use almost any text editor to open them.


In a world of social coding that’s only becoming more social, the programmer who doesn’t know Markdown will find themselves at a disadvantage (or, at the very least, confused for a little while).

You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *

## What is CSS?

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is, with a simple syntax example, and also covers some key terms about the language.

## What is CSS for?

in CSS, you can assign and control the style of HTML elements on a web page using a number of selectors. ID and class are two of the mostly used CSS selectors that not only help with building the layout of the HTML document but they also help with styling it.

## CSS syntax

h1 {
    color: red;
    font-size: 5em;
}

The rule opens with a selector . This selects the HTML element that we are going to style. In this case we are styling level one headings (<h1>).

We then have a set of curly braces { }. Inside those will be one or more declarations, which take the form of property and value pairs. Each pair specifies a property of the element(s) we are selecting, then a value that we'd like to give the property.
